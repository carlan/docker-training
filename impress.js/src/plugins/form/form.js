/**
 * Form support
 *
 * Functionality to better support use of input, textarea, button... elements in a presentation.
 *
 * Currently this does only one single thing: On impress:stepleave, de-focus any potentially active element.
 * This is to prevent the focus from being left in a form element that is no longer visible in the window, and
 * user therefore typing garbage into the form.
 *
 * TODO: Currently it is not possible to use TAB to navigate between form elements. Impress.js, and in particular the
 * navigation plugin, unfortunately must fully take control of the tab key, otherwise a user could cause
 * the browser to scroll to a link or button that's not on the current step. However, it could be possible to allow
 * tab navigation between form elements, as long as they are on the active step. This is a topic for further study.
