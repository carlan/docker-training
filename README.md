# Docker training

Hi, my name is Carlan.

This is a docker training that I'm planning to do (or did) for the developer team of my current employee.

### Topics

On this training I'll cover the subjects:

1. [Motivation and concepts](docs/docker_concepts.md)
2. [Docker basics](docs/docker_basics.md)

### Presentation

The slides can be found on [this link](http://github.com).

### Requirements

In order to follow up the training you'll need:

* Download and install [Oracle VM Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Download OVA file from [Sharepoint](https://is.gd/KfWx6B) and import it
   * This is just a Linux box with docker installed and basic tools
* Clone this repo (for sample files and slides)
* Basic knowledge of Linux
* If you found this useful, you can *star* this repo :)
